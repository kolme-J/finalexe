            In the 1860s, Batangas was
            already selling coffee to America, through San Francisco, and subsequently, with
            the opening of the Suez Canal, the Europe market opened. By 1880, the
            Philippines had become the fourth largest exporter of coffee beans, and when the
            coffee rust hit Brazil, Africa, and Java, it became the only source of coffee beans
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            Unfortunately, by the end of the decade, the coffee rust eventually reached the
            Philippine shores, destroying all the coffee trees in Batangas. The Philippine coffee
            industry experienced ups and downs thereafter and never recovered its glory
            days.1
            However, all is not lost for the Philippine coffee industry. Coffee is grown in 50
            countries along the equatorial zone called, “The Bean Belt”. Interestingly, the
            Philippines lies within the Bean Belt. Blessed with favorable climate and soil
            conditions, from the lowland to the mountain regions, the Philippines is also one
            of the few countries that produces the four varieties of commercially-viable coffee -
            Liberica, Excelsa, Robusta and Arabica.

            <h3>In 1980, the Philippines became a member of the International Coffee
              Organization, a group of importing and exporting coffee nations.

            <p>While Philippine coffee production
              remains relatively low and is unable to
              even meet local consumption demand
              (coffee production was at 62,062 metric
              tons of green coffee beans in 2019 but
              Filipinos consume 100,000 metric tons
              of coffee a year and drink almost as
              much coffee as the people of the United
              States, Brazil, Japan and the European
              Union), the Philippines is looking to be
              one of the leading producers of top-grade
              coffee around the world.</p>

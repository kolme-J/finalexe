              <h3>Boosts energy levels</h3>
              <p>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels.

                This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine.
                
                One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participants.
                
                Another study had similar findings, reporting that consuming caffeine before and during a round of golf improved performance, increased subjective energy levels, and reduced feelings of fatigue.</p>

              <h3>Could support brain health</h3>
              <p>Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

                According to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. What’s more, caffeine consumption also slowed the progression of Parkinson’s disease over time
                
                Another review of 11 observational studies in more than 29,000 people also found that the more coffee people consumed, the lower their risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
                
                Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption could be associated with a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline.</p>

              <h3>Linked to a lower risk of depression</h3>
              <p>Some studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of depression.

                According to one review of seven studies, each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to an 8% lower risk of depression.
                
                Another study found that drinking at least four cups of coffee each day was associated with a significantly lower risk of depression, compared with drinking just one cup per day.
                
                What’s more, one study in more than 200,000 people showed that drinking coffee was linked to a lower risk of death by suicide.</p>
